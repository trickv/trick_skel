Some notes on how to import a key from a yubikey locally:
https://gist.github.com/jacquesbh/79d3bbf6cdde41800491f55f13c1d8f0

Basically on a new workstation with yadm trick_skel do:
$ touch $HOME/.ssh/use-gpg
# spawn a new terminal
$ ssh-add -l # should show key inserted
$ gpg --card-edit
> fetch
# loads the private key into stub
$ opengpg # should succeed
$ ssh foo # should also work
